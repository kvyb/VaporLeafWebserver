# VaporLeafWebserver
Minimal webserver on Swift. Uses 'Vapor' and 'Leaf' for backend.

To make changes, ensure Xcode is installed.
Clone and navigate to project root.

```
Vapor Xcode
```

You should now have Xcode open. It will automatically begin downloading Swift Package Manager dependencies.

At the top of the window, to the right of the Play and Stop buttons, click on your project name to select the project's Scheme, and select an appropriate run targetâ€”most likely, "My Mac"

Note:
Explicitly specifying working directory is required for Leaf:
In Scheme -> Run -> Options -> Working Directory, set custom working directory to project root folder
